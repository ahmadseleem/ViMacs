;; Version: 20140212.2009
;; X-Original-Version: 2.1.5

;;; Commentary:

;; Require this script
;;
;;   (require 'indent-guide)
;;
;; and call command "M-x indent-guide-mode".

;; If you want to enable indent-guide-mode automatically,
;; call "indent-guide-global-mode" function.
;;
;;   (indent-guide-global-mode)

;; Column lines are propertized with "indent-guide-face". So you may
;; configure this face to make guides more pretty in your colorscheme.
;;
;;   (set-face-background 'indent-guide-face "dimgray")
;;
;; You may also change the character for guides.
;;
;;   (setq indent-guide-char ":")

;;; Change Log:

;; 1.0.0 first released
;; 1.0.1 cleaned and optimized code
;;       works better for the file without trailing-whitespaces
;; 1.0.2 modified behavior for lines with only whitespaces
;; 1.0.3 Allow custom indent guide char
;; 1.0.4 disabled in org-indent-mode
;; 1.0.5 faster update of indent-guide (especially for huge files)
;; 1.1.0 work with tab-indented files
;; 1.1.1 turned into minor-mode
;; 1.1.2 an infinite-loop bug fix
;; 1.1.3 changed behavior for blank lines
;; 2.0.0 rewrite almost everything
;; 2.0.1 improve blank-line and tab handling
;; 2.0.2 fixed bug that sometimes newline gets invisible
;; 2.0.3 added indent-guide-global-mode
;; 2.1.0 now lines are not drawn over the cursor
;; 2.1.1 work better with blank lines
;; 2.1.2 fixed bug in empty files
;; 2.1.3 better bob and eob handling
;; 2.1.4 use "display" property instead of "before-string"
;;       (now works better with hl-line and linum)
;; 2.1.5 add "indent-guide-inhibit-modes"
