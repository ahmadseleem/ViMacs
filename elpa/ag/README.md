# ag.el

Ag.el allows you to search using `ag` from inside Emacs. You can
filter by file type, edit results inline, or find files.

Ag.el tries very hard to be Do-What-I-Mean, and will make intelligent
suggestions about what to search and which directories to search in.

## Alternatives

* There's an ag plugin for helm: https://github.com/syohex/emacs-helm-ag

## Todo

* Remove `*-at-point` commands in favour of always defaulting to the
  symbol at point.
* Add aliases for the old command names to ensure backward
  compatibility.
* Modify `ag-regexp-project-at-point` to quote the default search
  string, otherwise `"foo.bar"` will match other things.
