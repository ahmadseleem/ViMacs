;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This package advises the `enable-theme' function and convert non-terminal colors
;; to their closest approximation. Inspired by VIM's CSApprox plugin
;; http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2390
;;
;; Normally Emacs does have non-terminal color themes degrade, however in some
;; system the effect is pretty poor. I've encountered this on Arch Linux and
;; Ubuntu (probably caused by some libvte weirdness).
;;
;;; Installation:
;; Add the to your .emacs or similar:
;;
;; (autoload 'color-theme-approximate-on "color-theme-approximate")
;; (color-theme-approximate-on)
;;
